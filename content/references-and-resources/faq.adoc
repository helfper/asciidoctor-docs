== FAQs

=== Does Asciidoctor only process text that is US-ASCII encoded?

No.
Asciidoctor has full Unicode support (UTF-8 by default, UTF-16 with a BOM).
ðŸ‘Œ

The "`Ascii`" in AsciiDoc and Asciidoctor merely refers to the range of characters from which the special characters in the syntax (section title markers, block delimiters, macro and block names, etc.) are drawn.
In other words, you only need to use characters from US-ASCII to form the structure of an AsciiDoc document.
The content itself, which includes attribute values, may contain characters from any character plane in Unicode.

Asciidoctor assumes input is encoded in UTF-8 and it encodes output documents in UTF-8 as well.

=== How do I make relative links to other AsciiDoc files to work correctly on GitHub?

[#converter-vs-backend]
=== What's the relationship between a converter and a backend?

//You can think of a backend as the keyword for a converter.

A [.term]*converter* is the software component in Asciidoctor that performs conversion from AsciiDoc to a publishable format.
A [.term]*backend* is an alias--kind of like a keyword--that identifies the converter to use.

The backend expresses an intent to transform to a certain format (e.g., `html5` for HTML5).
But it's more than just being shorter to type.
Multiple converters can bind to (i.e., stake claim to) the same backend in order to provide different approaches for performing that conversion.
For example, the backend `pdf` could activate Asciidoctor PDF, but it's also possible it means a different implementation.
The last converter bound to a backend wins.

//We might have used the word "format", but "backend" was the already established term in the AsciiDoc ecosystem.

=== What is the media type for AsciiDoc?

A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type[media type], or MIME type, is a code for identifying file formats and format contents transmitted on the Internet.

The first idea for an official MIME type for AsciiDoc came from the https://discuss.asciidoctor.org/Mimetype-for-Asciidoc-td211.html[Mimetype for AsciiDoc] discussion on the Asciidoctor mailinglist:

 text/x-asciidoc

Recently, the internet media type `text/markdown` was registered for Markdown, so a stronger case can now be made for:

 text/asciidoc

Either one will do, though it probably makes sense to align with Markdown on this one.

== Troubleshooting

=== Part way through the document, the blocks stop rendering correctly. What went wrong?

include::{includedir}/ts-block-render.adoc[tag=answer]

=== Why don't links to URLs that contain an underscore or caret work?

include::{includedir}/ts-url-format.adoc[tag=sb]
